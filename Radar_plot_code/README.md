# README.md
## Scripts were adapted from Dr. Paige Mundy (https://github.com/insideafish/larvae_behavior) to create radar plots from raw behavior velocity data outputs. Using fhm_behaviorplotdata_01192021.txt run fhm_stats_radarplot_SAS01192021.R first to produce stats for the radar plot, then run fhm_radarplot_SAS01252021.R to produce radar plots from an intermediate file CZMerge3.csv.
